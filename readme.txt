This lab performs matrix multiplication sequentially and using threads and compares both the results and displays the success message.

## How to build
To build this shell run "make" in linux shell or bash


## How to launch and quit

To launch this shell use "./mul" after building the shell

## Examples

Here are some example commands and their outputs from the program

1. 2 0
number of threads cannot be less than 1

2. 0 2 
Matrix size cannot be less than 1

3. -1 2
Matrix size cannot be less than 1

4. 2 -1
number of threads cannot be less than 1

5. 2 2
Success:Matrices are equal

6. 3 2
Success:Matrices are equal

7. 2 10
Success:Matrices are equal

8.100 100
Success:Matrices are equal
